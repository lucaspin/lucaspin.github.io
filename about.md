Howdy, my name is Lucas Augusto Pinheiro. I am a software developer from Brazil:
- Currently working at [Daitan](https://www.daitan.com/)
- [https://github.com/lucaspin](https://github.com/lucaspin)
- [https://twitter.com/lucaspinei](https://twitter.com/lucaspinei)

I enjoy understanding the inner workings of the interesting pieces that compose this beautiful world of ours and this is the place where I write about those discoveries.

I also enjoy tea and saving albums on Spotify and never listening to them. You can reach out to me through the upper-mentioned channels or [through email](mailto:pinheiro.lucasaugusto@gmail.com).
