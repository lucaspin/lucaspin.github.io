Howdy, my name is Lucas Augusto Pinheiro. I am aware that presenting yourself with your full name might be weird, but the appreciation for my second name comes and goes. Right now, it is quite present so I'm using it everywhere.

Anyway, I am a software developer from Brazil:
- Currently working @ [Daitan](https://www.daitan.com/)
- [https://github.com/lucaspin](https://github.com/lucaspin)
- [https://twitter.com/lucaspinei](https://twitter.com/lucaspinei)

I enjoy understanding the inner workings of the interesting things that compose this beautiful world of ours, but I find myself being lazy more often that I care to admit. In order to address both of these things, I realized that forcing myself to write is a great way to apply discipline and learn, while also consolidating knowledge. That is the purpose of this blog-like website.

Aside from that, I like tea and saving albums on Spotify and never listening to them.

You can reach out to me through the upper-mentioned channels or [through email](mailto:pinheiro.lucasaugusto@gmail.com).
