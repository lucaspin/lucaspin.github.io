Howdy, my name is Lucas Augusto Pinheiro. I am a software developer from Brazil, currently working at [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I enjoy understanding the inner workings of the interesting pieces that compose this beautiful world of ours and this is the place where I write about those discoveries.

I also enjoy tea and saving albums on Spotify and never listening to them. You can reach out to me through [Github](https://github.com/lucaspin){:target="_blank"}, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lucaspinei){:target="_blank"}, [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/lucaspinei/){:target="_blank"} or [through email](mailto:pinheiro.lucasaugusto@gmail.com).
