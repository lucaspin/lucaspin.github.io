Howdy, my name is Lucas Augusto Pinheiro. I am a software developer from Brazil.
- Currently working at [Daitan](https://www.daitan.com/){:target="_blank"}

I enjoy understanding the inner workings of the interesting pieces that compose this beautiful world of ours and this is the place where I write about those discoveries.

I also enjoy tea and saving albums on Spotify and never listening to them. You can reach out to me through the upper-mentioned channels or [through email](mailto:pinheiro.lucasaugusto@gmail.com).
